collect_inputs → Validate → fetch_stock_data → close_data → upward_downward_run → calculate_sma → maxProfitWithTransactions → display all/plot

Issue 1 
Main.py - I was thinking our main.py is too long. It should be for logic flow, no if/else (unless for functions). just calling functions.
Main.py - Reserved for high level logic only, basically system design logic

Issue 2 Programming: Code readability and comments
General - Use of better variable name with comments beside declaration of variable. 
(clear variable names and helpful comments throughout)
e.g change n in maxProfitWithTransactions
n → num_prices, i → idx/scan_idx

Issue 3 well- tested logic
Cover edge cases - for all functions
Catching Errors for every function, return function name" run successfully and "Error: ___Error for "function name"
Read up Try, Except to catch errors
e.g failure to plot, API failure.


SMA - duration, 1mo, SMA 200. Not shown on graph
collect_inputs - catch empty inputs
yf.Lookup - inputs like "d", "das" give results even though there isn't any ticker.
Move print table into function, is it necessary to print?
