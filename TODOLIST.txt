collect_inputs → Validate → fetch_stock_data → close_data → upward_downward_run → calculate_sma → maxProfitWithTransactions → display all/plot

Julius:
Accurately display ticker name in graph
Flask UX
2 smas in graph legend
Make sure dataframe as output works 
(easier reference if manual validation. Convertable to CSV for validation. In form of close prices, daily return, direction, buy/sell, SMA)

JL:
Replace repeittive code with daily return
daily returns function in stock_utils and used in up down runs, green red highlighting.
Better variable names, i, n
append relevant data into output dataframe for validation/CSV

Sinclair:
Redo SMA 
SMA - redo, i dont think can use rolling mean. it is supposed to use it as a validation test. Then, as a validation step, you compare your result with a trusted calculation method. For example, you can compare against the result produced by pandas’ built-in .rolling().mean() function,
SMA - if duration < SMA, tighten corner cases
append relevant data into output dataframe for validation/CSV

CJ:
Flask UX
Summary table in flask: longest_up_run_count, longest_down_run_count, up_count, down_count, up_run_count, down_run_count, Max profit, daily return average %
